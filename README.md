## Chat

You need a rabbitmq server for the plugin to make it work. Just replace the uri with you user and pass and the host.
You can have more info about the uri here : https://www.rabbitmq.com/uri-spec.html

⚠️ By default, player who join will listen to the channel "global" and will have his current channel set to the serverName in the configuration

The plugin/mod assume that a global channel is always defined and player who join the server will listen to the channel and the channel of the server by default

This an example to declare a channel :

```
channels:
    #You can put any alphanumeric name you want.
    <name>:
        format : "[GLOBAL] {prefix}{display_name} : &f{message}"
        alias: "g" # It's just an alias for the command
```

At this time you can use only this token :

```
{prefix} : Get the prefix from Vault (Bukkit) Or LuckPerms (Sponge)
{suffix} : Get the suffix from Vault (Bukkit) or LuckPerms (Sponge)
{display_name} : Get the displayname you have on the server
{message} : The message :)

You can put any color code beetwen the token or any characters if you want.
```

## Forge 1.16

The mod need FTBRanks to be working with a minimal version of 1605.1.5.

The config file is the same syntax as the sponge one.

The option are based on enum in the code : https://github.com/Mineaurion/Aurionchat/blob/master/common/src/main/java/com/mineaurion/aurionchat/common/Utils.java#L24

| Name                    | Value                  | Description                                                        |
|-------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Disallow URL and Domain | `DISALLOW`             | Disallow domain and url and replace it with "[url removed]"        |
| Disallow URL            | `DISALLOW_URL`         | Disallow only url and domain remain intact                         |
| Display only Domain     | `DISPLAY_ONLY_DOMAINS` | Replace any url with only the domain, the url is instact for click |

| Allow URLs              | `ALLOW`                | Allow url to be clickable and domain                               |


The `options.url_mode` configuration value is an array so you can add multiple to value to it. Be careful to respect the syntax of the value or the config will not work.
